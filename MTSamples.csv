SAMP-027;The examination shows lumbar vertebrae to be in normal overall alignment with preservation in vertebral body heights and normal signal within the marrow. For descriptive purposes of this study, fairly small disc is noted at the S1-S2 interspace. The tip of the conus lies near the lower body of L1; we believe this nomenclature is the same as that used on the prior exam. Transaxial images show postsurgical changes from prior right semi-hemilaminectomy at the S1 vertebra. Examination does show the presence of a small annular disc bulge and perhaps some early annular spurring; however, the traversing S1 nerve roots are unimpeded, and there is no evidence of recurrent focal disc herniation. There is some normal enhancement seen involving the soft tissues, presumably of a postoperative nature. At the L4-L5 level, there is likewise no evidence of focal disc herniation or significant central spinal stenosis. The L3-L4 interspace shows trace annular bulging without focal disc herniation or stenosis. L1-L2 and L2-L3 interspaces show a normal appearance on sagittal imaging.;MR examination of the lumbar spine with postsurgical changes from previous right semi-hemilaminectomy at L5-S1 level on the right. While there may be some minimal annular bulging and annular spurring at this level, there is no discrete focal disc herniation, and traversing S1 nerve roots are not compromised. The remainder of the lumbar interspaces may show some very minimal disc bulging, however, no focal disc herniation or central spinal stenosis. The cause of the patientâ€™s right lower extremity radicular symptoms cannot easily be explained on the basis of findings.

There is marked intervertebral disk space narrowing at the L5-S1 level with intervertebral disk vacuum phenomenon and advanced endplate degenerative changes. Posterior disk osteophyte complex is present, most marked in the left paracentral to lateral region extending into the lateral recess on the left. This most likely will affect the S1 nerve root on the left. There are posterior hypertrophic changes extending into the neural foramina bilaterally inferiorly. There is mild neural foraminal stenosis present. Small amount of extruded disk vacuum phenomenon is present on the left in the region of the exiting nerve root. There is facet sclerosis bilaterally. Mild lateral recess stenosis just on the right, there is prominent anterior spondylosis. At the L4-5 level, mild bilateral facet arthrosis is present. There is broad based posterior annular disk bulging or protrusion, which mildly effaces the anterior aspect of the thecal sac and extends into the inferior aspect of the neural foramina bilaterally. No moderate or high-grade central canal or neural foraminal stenosis is identified. At the L3-4 level anterior spondylosis is present. There are endplate degenerative changes with mild posterior annular disk bulging, but no evidence of moderate or high-grade central canal or neural foraminal stenosis. At the L2-3 level, there is mild bilateral ligamentum flavum hypertrophy.

SAMP-002;There is normal lumbosacral vertebral body height and alignment on this supine, non-weight bearing exam. Vertebral body marrow signal is normal. The conus medullaris is normal and terminates at L1. At T12-L1 there is mild secondary discogenic facet change without stenosis. At L1-L3 there are normal disc spaces with patent canal and foramina. At L3-L4 normal disc space show mild/moderate facet arthrosis with patent canal and foramina. At L4-L5 mild to moderate decreased disc signal and disc height with mild endplate spondylitic change, bulge and a left paracentral disc herniation extruded superiorly, 7 mm AP by 16 mm mL by 14 mm CC, with the left L5 nerve root sleeve impingement in the lateral recess, with severe right more than left facet arthrosis. Narrowing of the thecal sac, 8 mm, with mild left lateral recess stenosis, patent right lateral recess and mild to moderate left and mild right foraminal stenosis.

SAMP-006;No prior exams. Normal marrow stores are seen in the visualized osseous elements. The vertebral bodies are normal in height and alignment and normal cervical lordosis is seen. The craniovertebral junction is unremarkable. Disc desiccation is noted at all levels visualized in the cervical and upper thoracic spine. There is loss of disc height at C5-C6 and to a lesser degree at C6-C7. A small rounded focal lesion is seen in the leftward inferior end plate of T3 which measures 7 mm with signal intensity cost with fat. C2-C3 shows no disc herniation or bulging. No canal or foraminal stenosis. C3-C4 shows no disc herniation or bulging. No canal or foraminal stenosis. C4-C5 shows no disc herniation or bulging. No canal or foraminal stenosis. Mild right facet hypertrophy is noted. At C5-C6 level broad based mixed protrusion is seen which extends into the foramina and is slightly prominent left paracentrally. It results in ventral thecal sac effacement and there is slight flattening suggested of the leftward ventral aspect of the cord. In conjunction with uncovertebral joint spurring and facet hypertrophy there is moderate to severe bilateral foraminal stenosis. Mild central canal stenosis is noted. C6-C7 shows mild posterior disc bulging with uncovertebral joint spurring and facet hypertrophy resulting in mild bilateral foraminal stenosis. C7-T1 shows no disc herniation or bulging.

Posterior disc bulging with facet hypertrophy and uncovertebral joint spurring resulting in mild bilateral foraminal stenosis at C6-C7. Small hemangioma in the T3 vertebra.
SAMP-030;There are no compression fractures of the vertebral bodies. The vertebral bodies themselves have no abnormal lytic or blastic changes suggested. There is disk desiccation of the lower three intervertebral disk spaces and then again at T12-L1 and T11-12. L5-S1 suggests only a very minimal bulge. No axial images were completed through this region. At L4-5, there is a large annular bulge and significant facet hypertrophy. There is also a midline and right recess disk protrusion, which appears to occupy most of the right recess and neural foramen with a small amount of space still remaining at the most superior aspect of the neural foramen. This soft tissue disease in concert with facet disease does appear to significantly compress that right crossing nerve root. In addition, this combination of bone and soft tissue disease produces a trilateral narrowing of the spinal canal, which is moderately significant. There is some mild left neural foraminal narrowing at this level, but it is not as great as the compromise to the right. At L3-4, we again see trilateral narrowing of the spinal canal due to both disk and bony facet hypertrophy. Again, there is disk desiccation and some annular disk bulging at this level, which produces mild to moderate neural foraminal narrowing bilaterally. It is again greater to the right than the left. At L2-3, there is no disk desiccation and there is only a minimal bulge. There is some very minimal facet hypertrophy. Still, there is some narrowing of the spinal canal. A component of this may be due to congenitally short pedicles. The sagittal images also suggest some annular disk disease at T11-12, which protrudes to the central midline region. There also appears to be some facet hypertrophy bilaterally, though greater on the right. Axial images were not taken through this region, most likely due to the patient's discomfort. Should there be radicular symptoms that are felt to be related to this T11-12 disk space, we would be happy to have the patient come back for additional views and do an addendum at a later date.;No compression fractures, lytic or blastic changes to the vertebral bodies. No spondylolisthesis. An element of what may be congenitally short pedicles, which narrows the foramen of the spinal canal somewhat. Annular disk bulge with a midline and right recess disk broad-based protrusion with facet hypertrophy. This significantly compromises the right neural foramen and minimally to moderately compromises the left. Annular bulge, which lateralizes more to the right than the left at L3-4. There is an element of trilateral narrowing of the spinal canal both at L4-5 and at L3-4 in that order of severity due to this combination of bone and soft tissue disease.
SAMP-008;Radiographic examination of the spine by means of AP thoracic, lateral thoracic, APOM, AP lower cervical, neutral lateral cervical, cervical flexion and extension and left and right cervical oblique projections reveals the cervical spine to be hypolordotic with a moderate restriction of extension and a mild restriction of flexion. A right cervicothoracic convexity is noted apexing at C5-C6. Right head tilt is present. Bony hypertrophic changes are identified at the anterior C5 and C6 vertebral margins.

The vertebral bodies throughout the thoracic spine have normal height and alignment and the discs are of normal width. The pedicles and neural arches appear intact. Progressive degenerative changes have occurred on the left side between the first and fourth lumbar vertebrae inclusive, slightly increasing the scoliosis convexity towards the right. No fracture is identified.;
SAMP-010;MRI examination of the cervical spine reveals the vertebral bodies to be of normal height, without acute fracture. Type I subchondral degenerative signal alteration (low signal T1, high signal T2) is present at the inferior C4 and superior C5 vertebral margins. Decreased signal is noted throughout the cervical disks on the T2 weighted images, compatible with desiccation. Moderate decreases of disk height are appreciated at C4-C5, C5-C6 and C6-C7. The cervical spine is hypolordotic. Vertebral body alignment is otherwise unremarkable. The atlantodental interval is within normal limits. Small osteophytes are identified at the anterior C4 through C6 vertebral margins. A broad-based disk/osteophyte complex is evident at C3-C4 mildly flattening the ventral aspect of the cord. Mild bony narrowing of both neuroforamina is present. Subarachnoid bony hypertrophic changes are noted at C4-C5 with a superimposed right paracentral disk protrusion measuring 6.0 mm anteroposteriorly with substantial mass effect upon the ventral aspect of the cord. The central canal measures 4.5 mm anteroposteriorly at midline and 2.2 mm at the right paracentral aspect. A focal alteration of increased cord signal is evident on the T2 weighted images at C4-C5, measuring 14 mm in length and extends from the posterior aspect of the protrusion to the posterior aspect of the cord. Bilateral facet arthrosis is appreciated, appearing more advanced on the left. There is moderate and advanced bony narrowing of the left and right neuroforamina, respectively. A broad-based disk/osteophyte complex is noted at C5-C6 flattening the ventral aspect of the cord. The central canal measures 6.3 mm anteroposteriorly at midline.

The cerebellar tonsils are normally located.;Moderate degenerative disk disease, subchondral marrow signal alteration and osteophyte formation as described. Broad-based disk/osteophyte complex at C3-C4 mildly flattening the ventral aspect of the cord. This is complicated by mild bony narrowing of both neuroforamina. Subarachnoid bony hypertrophic changes at C4-C5 with a superimposed right paracentral disk protrusion measuring 6.0 mm anteroposteriorly with significant mass effect upon the ventral aspect of the cord and severe stenosis of the central canal.

Broad-based disk/osteophyte complex at C5-C6 flattening the cord, ventrally. The central canal measures 6.3 mm anteroposteriorly and there is advanced bony narrowing of both neuroforamina. Bilateral facet arthrosis is present. Broad-based disk/osteophyte complex at C6-C7 mildly lateralizing towards the right, minimally effacing the ventral aspect of the cord. This is complicated by severe bony narrowing of the right neuroforamen and bilateral facet arthrosis, appearing more advanced on the right.
SAMP-029;Sagittal and axial images were obtained. The upper lumbar spine is not well visualized due to body habitus and positioning within the coil. The conus appears grossly within normal limits, normal in location and signal intensity. The marrow signal appears within normal limits. There is marked narrowing at L5-S1 with some apparent fusion at this level to the left of midline. There is some minimal scoliosis. Marrow signal within the bony structures is unremarkable. At L5-S1, the nerve roots exit normally. There is some slight right neural foraminal narrowing on one image due to a combination of bone and disk; however, the neural foramina are patent on the next image. At L4-5, there is a mild disk bulge and posterior facet degenerative changes. Nerve roots are patent. At L3-4, there are some mild posterior facet degenerative changes, thickening of the ligamentum flavum, and neural foraminal narrowing. On the next image, the nerve roots exit normally.;There is some slight trilateral narrowing at L3-4. The nerve roots exit more normally on the next image. At L4-5, there is a disk bulge and some posterior facet degenerative changes. At L5-S1, there is a bulging disk and narrowing on the right with slight right neural foraminal narrowing on one image. On the next, the neural foramina are more patent. There is no focal disk herniation.
SAMP-018;At L5-S1 there is evidence of a large central-to-right side disc protrusion at this level, which results in displacement and compromise of the subarticular portion of the right S1 root. Left S1 root does not appear affected. At L4-L5 there is significant disc space narrowing with central disc herniation of moderate size. This results in partial effacement of the ventral portion of the thecal sac. No clear indication of any compromise of either exiting root however. The L3-L4 level is by far is the most affected with disc space narrowing. Both the sagittal and axial images indicate large disc protrusion centrally and slightly to the right side. I believe this serves to compromise the thecal sac significantly. Herniated disc material, which still appears contiguous with the disc space occupies the majority of the thecal sac showing significant effacement. At L2-L3 there is normal cross-sectional appearance without epidural compromise of the canal or roots.;Multilevel degenerative changes. Most affected level appears at L3-L4 with large central-to-right side disc protrusion remaining contiguous with the disc space. Disc material occupies the majority of the remaining thecal sac, which shows significant effacement. L4-L5 shows moderate central disc herniation without either left or right side predominance. Thecal sac appears compromised as a result. L5-S1 shows large central-to-right side disc herniation resulting in compromise of the subarticular portion of the right S1 root.

At C7-T1 there is prominent disc protrusion to the left side serving to severely compromise the C7-T1 level on the left. Right side foramen shows patency. There is partial effacement of the cord on the left side. No abnormal cord signal change. At C6-C7 there is desiccation together with loss of disc height. Prominent left side disc protrusion as well serving to severely compromise the left side C6-C7 foramen. Partial effacement of the cord on the left side as a result. I believe there is a component to the right side, which also severely compromises the right side C6-C7 foramen. No abnormal cord signal change. At C5-C6 there is evidence of a large central focal disc protrusion to the left side serving to significantly efface the left side of the cord. No abnormal cord signal change. The disc to the left severely compromises the C5-C6 foramen. I believe, there is probable uncinate hypertrophy and perhaps a disc component serving to severely compromise the C5-C6 foramen. No indication of any abnormal signal change within the cord or formation of a syrinx. At C4-C5 similar findings with left side disc herniation severely compromising the left side C4-C5 foramen. Right side foramen shows relatively wide patency. Partial effacement of the left side of the cord. At C3-C4 there is large central disc protrusion serving to ventrally efface the cord. No abnormal cord signal change however. I believe there is severe compromise of the left side C3-C4 foramen as a result of the soft tissue component. Right side foramen shows patency. At C2-C3 there is normal cross-sectional appearance.;Multilevel degenerative changes affecting primarily C6-C7, C5-C6 and C3-C4 most severely. Cord appears most compromised at the C3-C4 level due to the central nature of the disc. No abnormal cord signal change however. C5-C6 shows more focal eccentric left side disc herniation serving to severely compromise the left side of the cord. I do not identify any specific abnormal signal within the cord to suggest contusion or suggestion of a syrinx.
SAMP-023;Cervical spine radiographs demonstrate evidence of spondylosis including degenerative disk disease and anterior and posterior osteophyte formation at C4-5, C5-6, C6-7, and C3-4 demonstrates only minimal if any degenerative disk disease. There is no significant instability seen on flexion-extension views. Cervical spine MRI demonstrates evidence of moderate stenosis at C4-5, C5-6.

Vertebral body alignment is anatomic. There is no evidence of disk displacement/derangement or bony central canal stenosis.;Bony neoplasm with cortical destruction, soft tissue mass and effacement of the distal cord and involvement of the left L1 spinal nerve. Diagnostic considerations include osteoblastoma, giant cell tumor, aneurysmal bone cyst or other atypical aggressive neoplastic process. Osteolytic metastatic disease is a possibility, however unlikely considering the patient is 21 years of age.

The changes are similar to those noted on the MRI. Please see complete discussion above.
SAMP-026;MRI examination of the lumbar spine is performed using the following protocol: T1 weighted and T2 weighted axial and sagittal sequences. The lumbar vertebral alignment is well maintained. The vertebral body heights and disc spaces are well maintained. Normal T2 hyperintensities are seen within all the discs in the lumbar spine. Axial scans are done from disc space level L2-L3 through L5-S1. At disc space levels L4-L5 and L5-S1, there are very minimal diffuse disc bulges. There is no focal disc herniation, canal stenosis or foraminal narrowing seen at any of the levels in the lumbar spine.;Very minimal diffuse disc bulges seen at levels L4-L5 and L5-S1. There is no disc herniation, canal stenosis or foraminal narrowing seen at any of the levels in the lumbar spine.
SAMP-028;Sagittal and axial images were obtained. The craniocervical junction is within normal limits. Spinal cord is normal in location and signal intensity. There is straightening of the normal curvature. Marrow signal within the bony structures is unremarkable. At C7-T1, there is no focal disk disease. At C6-7, there is a disk bulge which causes mild flattening of the anterior CSF space and some neural foraminal narrowing, left greater than right. At C5-6, there is a combination of disk bulge and posterior osteophytes, which narrows the neural foramina and flattens the anterior CSF space, more so than at the C6-7 level. At C4-5, there is a disk bulge, which flattens the anterior CSF space and causes some bilateral neural foraminal narrowing, left greater than right. At C3-4, there is a combination of bone and disk, which slightly flattens the anterior CSF space and narrows the neural foramina bilaterally.;Some mild multilevel disk disease, as described above, with some disk bulges and posterior osteophytes. There is no frank disk herniation.
SAMP-019;Sagittal images indicate multilevel changes primarily affecting the T9-T10, T8-T9, T7-8 and T6-T7 levels. Review of the earlier examination has been made. The addition of the contrast highlights postoperative changes involving the posterior elements through these levels. Detail is more exquisite with the addition of contrast. At T9-T10 there remains a large central-to-right side disc herniation serving to efface the thecal sac. I would estimate this to represent a severe stenosis as a result of the epidural compromise from the remaining disc. These findings, I believe, are also confirmed on the sagittal images. At T8-T9 there are similar findings with epidural compromise as a result of the large disc protrusion, central and to the left. As a result, the remaining thecal sac appears effaced and displaced to the right side. At T7-T8 the findings again demonstrate disc protrusion, central and to the left side. Cord does not show any significant effacement or displacement at this level. At T6-T7 there is large disc protrusion, central and to the right. As a result, the cord shows slight displacement to the left side. No significant effacement of the cord however.;Current examination is better detailed than when compared to the previous study. I believe the postcontrast images offer the best detail of the thoracic canal and ultimately the cord. Significant epidural compromise of the thecal sac and ultimately the cord at the levels of T9-T10, T8-T9, T7-T8 and T6-T7. Most affected levels appear at T9-T10 with large central-to-right side disc component serving to significantly efface the thecal sac and ultimately the cord at this level. Large disc protrusion at T8-T9 displacing the remaining thecal sac and cord to the right side. Disc protrusions at T7-T8 and T6-T7, however, not as severe as the other two levels. Postoperative changes as discussed. It is difficult to compare these studies with the previous films. The postcontrast T1 weighted images are much improved when compared to the earlier study offering better detail.

There is mild-to moderate broad-based disk protrusion with shallow midline/left paramedian disk herniation. Left neural foramina is somewhat narrowed when compared to the right. Sagittal images obtained in flexion reveal limited range of motion. There was no evidence of instability, pathologic offset or alteration in posterior disk margin.

At C2-3 there is normal intervertebral disc with no spondylosis or uncovertebral joint arthrosis. Normal central canal and intervertebral neural foramina with no cord or radicular impingement. At C3-4 there is disc desiccation with minimal annular bulging. The residual AP diameter of the central canal measures approximately 10mm. CSF remains present surrounding the cord. At C4-5: there is disc desiccation with endplate spondylosis and mild uncovertebral joint arthrosis. The residual AP diameter of the central canal measures approximately 8mm with effacement of the circumferential CSF cleft producing a borderline central canal stenosis but no cord distortion or cord edema. There is minimal uncovertebral joint arthrosis. At C5-6 there is disc desiccation with minimal posterior annular bulging and a right posterolateral preforaminal disc protrusion measuring approximately 2 x 8mm (AP x transverse). The disc protrusion produces minimal rightward ventral thecal sac flattening but no cord impingement. At C6-7 there is disc desiccation with mild loss of disc space height and posterior endplate spondylosis and annular bulging producing central canal stenosis. The residual AP diameter of the central canal measures 8 mm with effacement of the circumferential CSF cleft. There is a left posterolateral disc-osteophyte complex encroaching upon the left intervertebral neural foramen with probable radicular impingement upon the exiting left C7 nerve root. At C7-T1, T1-2 there is minimal disc desiccation with no disc displacement or endplate spondylosis.;Multilevel degenerative disc disease as described above. C4-5 borderline central canal stenosis with mild bilateral foraminal compromise. C5-6 disc desiccation with a borderline central canal stenosis and a right posterolateral preforaminal disc protrusion producing thecal sac distortion. C6-7 degenerative disc disease and endplate spondylosis with a left posterolateral disc-osteophyte complex producing probable neural impingement upon the exiting left C7 nerve root with a borderline central canal stenosis. Normal cervical cord.
SAMP-043;The cervical spine demonstrates normal alignment and mineralization with no evidence of fracture, dislocation, or spondylolisthesis. The vertebral body heights and disc spaces are maintained. The central canal is patent. The pedicles and posterior elements are intact. The paravertebral soft tissues are within normal limits. The atlanto-dens interval and the dens are intact. The visualized lung apices are clear.;No acute abnormalities.
SAMP-051;MRI of the cervical spine without contrast showed normal vertebral body height and alignment with normal cervical cord signal. At C4-C5, there were minimal uncovertebral osteophytes with mild associated right foraminal compromise. At C5-C6, there were minimal diffuse disc bulge and uncovertebral osteophytes with indentation of the anterior thecal sac, but no cord deformity or foraminal compromise. At C6-C7, there was a central disc herniation resulting in mild deformity of the anterior aspect of the cord with patent neuroforamina. MRI of the thoracic spine showed normal vertebral body height and alignment. There was evidence of disc generation, especially anteriorly at the T5-T6 level. There was no significant central canal or foraminal compromise. Thoracic cord normal in signal morphology. MRI of the lumbar spine showed normal vertebral body height and alignment. There is disc desiccation at L4-L5 and L5-S1 with no significant central canal or foraminal stenosis at L1-L2, L2-L3, and L3-L4. There was a right paracentral disc protrusion at L4-L5 narrowing of the right lateral recess. The transversing nerve root on the right was impinged at that level. The right foramen was mildly compromised. There was also a central disc protrusion seen at the L5-S1 level resulting in indentation of the anterior thecal sac and minimal bilateral foraminal compromise.;Overall impression was mild degenerative changes present in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine without high-grade central canal or foraminal narrowing. There was narrowing of the right lateral recess at L4-L5 level and associated impingement of the transversing nerve root at that level by a disc protrusion. This was also seen on a prior study.
SAMP-054;AP and lateral views of the thoracic spine, including a "swimmer's" projection for the upper thoracic spine, demonstrate satisfactory bony alignment. There is preservation of the vertebral body heights and disc spaces. No fractures or loss of normal bony architecture is seen. No paravertebral masses are identified.;Negative thoracic spine.
SAMP-045;There is reversal of the normal cervical curvature at the vertebral body heights. The intervertebral disk spaces are otherwise maintained. There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling. The facets are aligned. The tip of the clivus and occiput appear intact. On the coronal reconstructed sequence, there is satisfactory alignment of C1 on C2, no evidence of a base of dens fracture. The included portions of the first and second ribs are intact. There is no evidence of a posterior element fracture. Included portions of the mastoid air cells appear clear. There is no CT evidence of a moderate or high-grade stenosis.;No acute process, cervical spine.
SAMP-062;MRI L-spine, 7/3/93, revealed an area of abnormally increased T2 signal extending from T12 through L5. This area causes anterior displacement of the spinal cord and nerve roots. The cauda equina are pushed up against the posterior L1 vertebral body. There bilaterally pulmonary effusions. There is also abnormally increased T2 signal in the center of the spinal cord extending from the mid thoracic level through the conus. In addition, the Fila Terminale appear thickened. There is increased signal in the T3 vertebral body suggestion a hemangioma. The findings were felt consistent with a large epidural lipoma displacing the spinal cord anteriorly. there also appeared spinal cord swelling and increased signal within the spinal cord which suggests an intramedullary process.;
SAMP-055;Frontal and lateral views of the lumbar spine demonstrate satisfactory bony alignment with no fractures or loss of normal bony architecture. There is preservation of the vertebral body heights and disc spaces. No paravertebral masses are evident. There is no fracture.;Negative.
SAMP-056;MRI C-spine, 12/1/92: Congenitally small spinal canal is present. Superimposed on this is mild spondylosis and disc bulge at C6-7, C5-6, C4-5, and C3-4. There is moderate central spinal stenosis at C3-4. Intervertebral foramina at these levels appear widely patent.;Left Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
SAMP-058;MRI of the brain from 05/02/06 and MRI of the C-spine from 05/02/06 and 07/25/06 were personally reviewed. MRI of the brain is broadly within normal limits. MRI of the C-spine reveals large central disc herniation at C6-C7 with evidence of mild cord compression and abnormal signal in the cord suggesting cord edema. There is also a fairly large disc at C3-C4 with cord deformity and partial effacement of the subarachnoid space. I do not appreciate any cord edema at this level.;The patient is a 45-year-old female with cervical spondylosis with a large C6-C7 herniated disc with mild cord compression and signal change at that level. She has a small disc at C3-C4 with less severe and only subtle cord compression. History and examination are consistent with signs of a myelopathy.
SAMP-039;There is no evidence for acute fracture or subluxation. There is no spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis. The central canal and neuroforamen are grossly patent at all levels. There are no abnormal paraspinal masses. There is no wedge/compression deformity. There is intervertebral disk space narrowing to a mild degree at L2-3 and L4-5. Soft tissue windows demonstrate atherosclerotic calcification of the abdominal aorta, which is not dilated. There was incompletely visualized probable simple left renal cyst, exophytic at the lower pole.;No evidence for acute fracture or subluxation. Mild degenerative changes. Probable left simple renal cyst.
