SAMP-002

FINDING: There is normal lumbosacral vertebral body height and alignment on this supine, non-weight bearing exam. Vertebral body marrow signal is normal. The conus medullaris is normal and terminates at L1. At T12-L1 there is mild secondary discogenic facet change without stenosis. At L1-L3 there are normal disc spaces with patent canal and foramina. At L3-L4 normal disc space show mild/moderate facet arthrosis with patent canal and foramina. At L4-L5 mild to moderate decreased disc signal and disc height with mild endplate spondylitic change, bulge and a left paracentral disc herniation extruded superiorly, 7 mm AP by 16 mm mL by 14 mm CC, with the left L5 nerve root sleeve impingement in the lateral recess, with severe right more than left facet arthrosis. Narrowing of the thecal sac, 8 mm, with mild left lateral recess stenosis, patent right lateral recess and mild to moderate left and mild right foraminal stenosis. At L5-S1 mild decreased disc signal with mild/moderate decreased disc height and endplate spondylitic change, bulge and left paracentral disc herniation, 3 mm AP by 8mm mL, with left S1 nerve root sleeve impingement in the lateral recess, with moderate facet arthrosis. Patent canal and right lateral recess and right foramen with minor left foraminal stenosis. No paraspinal masses or collections.
