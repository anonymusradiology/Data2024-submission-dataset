SAMP-014

FINDING: The central skull base is intact. The central petrous temporal bones and mastoids remain clear. The visualized base of brain appears unremarkable. Cervical spondylosis is noted, most notable for a broad-based disc bulge and dorsal osteophytic ridge at the C5/6 level with a C6/7 level focal 2 mm central disc protrusion and dorsal osteophytic ridging, resulting in mild central spinal stenosis. Mild foraminal narrowing also evident bilaterally.
