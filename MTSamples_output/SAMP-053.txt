SAMP-053

FINDING: AP, lateral with flexion and extension, and both oblique projections of the cervical spine demonstrate alignment and soft tissue structures to be unremarkable. The vertebral bodies and the disc spaces appear normal. Oblique views demonstrate the intervertebral foramina to be of normal size and appearance. The odontoid view demonstrates the C1-2 structures to be in anatomical alignment. Additional flexion and extension views in the lateral position demonstrate normal physiologic movement with no evidence of subluxation or fixation.
