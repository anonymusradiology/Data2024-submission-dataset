FINDING: The thoracic spine was examined in the AP, lateral and swimmer's projections. There is mild chronic-appearing anterior wedging of what is believed to represent T11 and 12 vertebral bodies. A mild amount of anterior osteophytic lipping is seen involving the thoracic spine. There is a suggestion of generalized osteoporosis. The intervertebral disc spaces appear generally well preserved.
