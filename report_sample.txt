The cervical cord appears normal in its size and signal characteristics. The C2-3 and C3-4 discs are degenerated. At C2-3 there is disc desiccation with a posterior central disc herniation. There is some mild bulging of the C3-4 disc. Neither level demonstrates central or neural foraminal narrowing. At C4-5 and C5-6 there is no recurrent central or neural foraminal narrowing. At C6-7 there is mild bilateral bony neural foraminal narrowing without central canal compromise. The C7-T1 level appears unremarkable. MRI of the brain is broadly within normal limits.
